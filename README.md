# Wasteland Vehicle Extraction Shooter MVP

A Unity 6 multiplayer vehicle extraction shooter prototype designed to establish and validate core technical systems for future development. This MVP focuses on proving multiplayer networking, vehicle physics, combat synchronization, inventory management, and map traversal using Unity primitives.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project serves as a technical foundation prototype for a Mad Max-style extraction shooter, emphasizing:

- **Multiplayer Foundation**: Stable 4-8 player sessions with <100ms latency
- **Vehicle Physics**: Realistic vehicle handling with multiplayer support
- **Combat System**: Server-authoritative hit detection with lag compensation
- **Inventory Management**: Grid-based inventory with network synchronization
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS with 8 concurrent players

## 🛠️ System Requirements

### Development Environment
- **Unity Version**: Unity 6 (2023.3 LTS or later)
- **Platform**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Ubuntu 18.04+
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB free space
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for multiplayer testing

### Target Runtime
- **Platform**: PC (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **CPU**: Quad-core 2.5GHz or equivalent
